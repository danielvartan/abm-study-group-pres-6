#' **IMPORTANT**
#'
#' Leave this code commented out unless you need to regenerate the bibliography
#' for Quarto documents from Zotero using Better BibTeX. This code cannot be run
#' in the CI/CD pipeline because it depends on having Zotero installed locally
#' with Better BibTeX configured.
#'
#' Uncheck the option "Apply title-casing to titles" in Zotero Better BibTeX
#' preferences (Edit > Settings > Better BibTeX > Miscellaneous).
#'
#' (2024-08-25)
#' This function should work with any version of BetterBibTeX (BBT) for Zotero.
#' Verify if @wmoldham PR was merged in the `rbbt` package (see issue #47
#' <https://github.com/paleolimbot/rbbt/issues/47>). If not, install `rbbt` from
#' @wmoldham fork `remotes::install_github("wmoldham/rbbt", force = TRUE)`.
